Markdown Basics
------
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is like the Oxford-Dictionary of English for First Graders. Markdown is easy-to-write, and easy-to-read, and is faster than old **add-link** and **select bold text** editors.

----
Basic writing

**Paragraphs**

Paragraphs in Markdown are just one or more lines of consecutive text followed by one or more blank lines.

Like this:

>I am afraid of ghosts, Pudge, and home is full of them.

>The labyrinth of suffering.

----
Headings

You can create a heading by adding one or more # symbols before your heading text. The number of # is inversely proportional to the size of the text.

># The largest heading
>## The second largest heading
>#### The fourth largest heading

----
Blockquotes

You can indicate blockquotes with a `>`.

###In the words of Ted Mosby:

> When it is past 2 am, go to your home and sleep.

----

Styling text

You can make text bold or italic.

One `*` or *_* arround the text is italic, two is **bold**.

>\*This text will be italic\*
*This text will be italic*



>\*\*This text will be bold**
**This text will be bold**

-----

Unordered lists

You can make an unordered list by preceding list items with either a * or a -.

\* Item
<br>
\* Item
<br>
\* Item

\- Item<br>
\- Item<br>
\- Item

----
Ordered lists
----

You can make an ordered list by preceding list items with a number.

1. Item
2. Item
3. Item
Nested lists

You can create nested lists by indenting list items by two spaces.

>1. Item 1
  1. A corollary to the above item.
  2. Yet another point to consider.
2. Item 2
  * A corollary that does not need to be ordered.
    * This is indented four spaces, because it's two spaces further than the item above.
    * You might want to consider making a new list.
3. Item 3

----

Links


You can create an inline link by using this syntax: 

`[Text to appear in place of link](URL)`

Example:

`[BlanketCoffee](//www.blanketcoffee.com).`

will result in

[BlanketCoffee](//www.blanketcoffee.com).

----
Images

Images are just like links, except the fact that their syntax precedes an exclamation mark `!`.

`![Alternate text to be shown when image is not loaded for some idiotic reason](URL of the image)`

Example:

`![Alright](https://goo.gl/TgwwU5).`

will result in

<img src="https://goo.gl/TgwwU5" class="responsive-img">

----
Description Tag


That is about it, for Markdown. And wait, hang on.

The description text shown on the posts list on the blog is explicitly added using this syntax:

`//#description// --Your Description text-- //description#//`

Don't worry. It will be trimmed in the blog post. Happy Writing.
