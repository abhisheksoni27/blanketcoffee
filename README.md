# Open Source

Open Blog explained: The sole reason this was made was to reduce the gap between post from authors who are famaous, and awesome, and those who were awesome at writing but weren't famous yet. Open blog means, we can write together, on the same feeging blog.

#Goodies and Souvenirs

Goodies and Souvenirs: Good posts are not only rewarded by companies and magazines reading your post, we reward you too. Check it out in FAQ section.


# About Us

>What if the stars in the sky are bullet holes left by berzerk wars?

Those are the kind of metaphors that are awesome at being metaphors.

Okay, now that you are here, let us tell you one thing:

Here's how this place works:

When you first log in, you will be shown a dashboard, which you are going to spend a lot of time on, and there will be a button asking you if you wanted to __write a post__, and if you click that, you will be taken to the editor page, and that editor is a good one, alright, (Maybe, you'd like to have a look at it.):



And it uses a special type of writing library, which is known as Markdown, and it is as easy to learn as First grade Maths at twenty-two years of age.

And we have written a comprehensive guide on how to learn Markdown here: [How to Markdown](http://blanketcofee.com/howtomarkdown).

On the last scene of that page, is a syntax as to how to write a description tag for your blog post.

`//#description// --Your Description text-- //description#//`

It is of utmost importance to include that description text, or else your blog post will not be parsed. It will be there, but unless you edit it, nothing will be shown on the blog. It should always be declared at the start of the post.


It might interest you that every blog post has an image associated to it, which is shown on the blog list page, and obviously, is extracted from the blog post. As for best practices, we advice you to atleast include one imagge per plog post.



We are a gang of three and you can get to know us if you head over to the Mad link on the homepage. [MAD](http://blanketcofee.com/mad)

Our charms include:

>How I met your Mother. ( __True Story__ )

>Harry Potter Series ( __Not my daughter, Bitch.__ )

>And Books. ( __Need we say more?__ )

And we guess it is about time we said this:

>As long as we don't die, this is gonna be one hell of a story.


That's it folks. Happy Coffee.
